\section{Gradient Descent Algorithm}

As a termination condition [w]=0 used. Algorithm will also terminated after significant (10000) number of iterations, which indicates that
	n is either too big or too small
	Network design (single neuron in our case) is insufficient for getting desired results
Results of 10 runs of the algorithm for different reasonable n are shown below. For particular function that was tested selecting initial weights randomly lead to increase of number of iterations required.
