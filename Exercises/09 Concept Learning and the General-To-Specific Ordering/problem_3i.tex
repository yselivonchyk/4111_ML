\subsection*{Problem (i)}

For the candidate algorithm we start with the general boundary 
\[
G_{0}=\left\{ 1\right\} 
\]
and the specific boundary
\[
S_{0}=\left\{ \bigwedge_{i\in\{1,\ldots,6\}}\left(x_{i}\land\lnot x_{i}\right)\right\} 
\]
of the version space $\mathit{VS}_{\mathcal{H}_{6},E}$. After observing
the three positive example $\in E^{+}$, the general boundary is not
iterated. 
\[
G_{3}=G_{2}=G_{1}=G_{0}
\]
The specific boundary is iterated after each positive example, such
that
\[
S_{1}=\left\{ \bigwedge_{i\in\{1,\ldots,6\}}\left(x_{i}\right)\right\} ,
\]
\[
S_{2}=\left\{ \bigwedge_{i\in\{1,\ldots,6\}\setminus3}x_{i}\right\} ,
\]


\[
S_{3}=\left\{ \bigwedge_{i\in\{1,2,4\}}x_{i}\right\} .
\]
The observation of the negative example $\in E^{-}$ does not cause
the algorithm to modify the specific boundary.
\[
S_{4}=S_{3}=\left\{ \bigwedge_{i\in\{1,2,4\}}x_{i}\right\} 
\]
However, the general boundary becomes
\[
G_{4}=\left\{ x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},\lnot x_{4},\lnot x_{5},x_{6}\right\} .
\]
The algorithm returns the sets of conjunctions
\[
S=\left\{ x_{1}\land x_{2}\land x_{4}\right\} ,\; G=\left\{ x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},\lnot x_{4},\lnot x_{5},x_{6}\right\} .
\]
