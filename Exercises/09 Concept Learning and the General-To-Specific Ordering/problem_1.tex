Reflexivity and antisymmetry are trivial, so we will just show transitivity. Assume \(a\leq b\) and \(b \leq c\) then we have \(\forall_{x\in X} c(x) = 1 \Rightarrow b(x) = 1 \Rightarrow a(x) = 1\), where the first implication follows from \(b \leq c\) and the second from \(a\leq b\). Hence, we get \(a\leq c\), as required.
