Let \(X=\mathbb{R}^2\) and let the concept class \(\mathcal C\) over \(X\) be the set of all axis parallel rectangles.
\subsection*{Problem (i)}
Notice that if we have a non-discrete probability distribution \(D\) on \(X\), then we cannot bound the number of mistakes. This is because each point is taken from \(X\)  with probability 0 and the chance that we will get the real concept \(c\) has probability 0. Hence, after a finite number of improvements of our model it will be still not correct with probability 1 and we will have still infinitely many points that are wrongly classified. \\
So, this is not possible to learn a target concept \(c \in \mathcal{C}\) in the online mistake bound model.
