\subsection*{Problem a)}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a concept class with $|\mathcal{C}| < \infty$.\\
Show that $VC_{dim}(\mathcal{C}) \leq \log _2 |\mathcal{C}|$.\\
\\
\textbf{\underline{\textit{Proof:}}}\\
Let $X$ be the instance space and
let $VC_{dim}(\mathcal{C}) = d$ with $d\in \mathbb{N}$.\\
This means that the largest subset $S$ of $X$ that is shattered by $\mathcal{C}$ is of size $d$, i.e. $|S|=d$.\\ 
This again means that any(!!!) subset of  $S$ can be \textit{realized} by some concept in $\mathcal{C}$.\\ 
Since $|S|$ is bounded by $d$, the number of its subsets is bounded by
$|2^{S}|= 2^{|S|} = 2^d$.\\ 
Because for each subset of $S$ there must exist a concept in $\mathcal{C}$ that \textit{realizes} it,\\ 
we can conclude $|\mathcal{C}| \geq |2^{S}|= 2^d$,\\ 
thus $\log _2|\mathcal{C}| \geq d$.
\hfill $\square$
