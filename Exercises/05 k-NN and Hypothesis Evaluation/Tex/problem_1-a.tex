\subsection*{Problem (a)}
Take an \(n\geq 3\). Consider the set of points lying on a unitary circle and forming a regular \(n\)-gon, namely:
\[P = \{e^0, e^{\frac{2 i \pi}{n}} , e^{\frac{ 4 i \pi}{n}},\dots , e^{\frac{ 2(n-1) i \pi}{n}}\} \subset \mathbb C\ \  (\cong \mathbb R^2)\]
then the edges of the Voronoi diagram of \(P\) will be rays with the initial point 0, and going through points:
\[  \{e^{\frac{ i \pi}{n}}, e^{\frac{3 i \pi}{n}} , e^{\frac{ 5 i \pi}{n}},\dots , e^{\frac{ (2n-1) i \pi}{n}}\}\]
Hence all Voronoi edges are unbounded, so also all the Voronoi cells will be unbounded, as required.
