\subsection*{Problem (b)}

For 90\% one-sided confidence interval we should use different value of z:
 \[
z_2=1.19, P(x\in Z_2)=0.9015
\]
One-sided confidence interval in our case will look as follows:
 \[
x\in \{0, \bar{x}+z_2*\sigma\},
x\in \{0, 13.46\}
\]
Therefore, we can say that true error is upper-bounded by value 14 with probability at least 90\%.
