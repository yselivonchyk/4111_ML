Lets look up value z, that allows to build the two-sided confidence interval for 95\% probability.
 \[
z_1=1.96,\; P(x\in Z_1)=0.9500
\]
In this case width of confidence interval will be as follows:
 \[
w = 2\cdot z \cdot\sigma= 3.92\cdot\sigma
\]
But we would like to have it at most $0.1\cdot n$ wide
 \[
3.92\cdot\sigma<0.1\cdot n,
\]
 \[
\sigma<0.0255\cdot n
\]
We know that
 \[
\sigma=\sqrt{n\cdot p\cdot q}<0.0255\cdot n,
\]
 \[
\frac{p\cdot q}{0.0255^2}<n,
\]
 \[
n>1,537.9\cdot pq,\; \text{where } pq = p\cdot(1-p)=p - p^2
\]
Lets take a look at function 
 \[
f(p) = p\cdot(1-p)=p - p^2
\]
This function has single critical point $p = 0.5$ on the interval $[0.2, 0.6]$ and this point is absolute maximum of the function. Lets use this point to upper bound the $n$:
 \[
n>1,537.9\cdot 0.5^2,\; n>384.475
\]
Therefore, regardless of the actual error value we need to performs at least 385 experiments to guarantee, that width of the confidence interval of the actual error is at most 0.1.
