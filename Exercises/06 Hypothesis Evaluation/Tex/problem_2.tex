Lets look up value z, that allows to build the two-sided confidence interval for 95\% probability.
 \[
z_1=1.96, P(x\in Z_1)=0.9500
\]
In this case width of confidence interval will be as follows:
 \[
w = 2*z*\sigma= 3.92*\sigma
\]
But we would like to have it at most 0.1*n wide
 \[
3.92*\sigma<0.1*n,
\]
 \[
\sigma<0.0255*n
\]
We know that
 \[
\sigma=\sqrt{n*p*q}<0.0255*n,
\]
 \[
\frac{p*q}{0.0255^2}<n,
\]
 \[
n>1,537.9*pq,\textvisiblespace where\textvisiblespace pq = p*(1-p)=p - p^2
\]
Lets take a look at function 
 \[
f(p) = p*(1-p)=p - p^2
\]
This function has single critical point p = 0.5 on the interval [0.2, 0.6] and this point is absolute maximum of the function. Lets use this point to upper bound the n:
 \[
n>1,537.9*0.5^2, n>384.475
\]
Therefore, regardless of the actual error value we need to performs at least 385 experiments to guarantee, that width of the confidence interval of the actual error is at most 0.1.
