The numerical results for this problem can be found in table \ref{tab:result-table}.
If the positive examples are concentrated among the \emph{first} few
examples, the AUC increases. In the extreme case that all positive
examples are placed before the negative examples, the AUC equals 1.
In contrast, if the positive examples are concentrated among the \emph{last}
few examples, the AUC decreases. If in the extreme case, all the positive
examples are positioned after the negative examples, the AUC equals
0.
